					<h3>Who should attend?</h3>
					<p>CoderDojo is open to students aged 7-17. We have
						kids who attend public school, kids who attend private school, 
						as well as kids who are home schooled. 
					</p>
					<p>
						You do not have to have any coding experience! However,
						we do split into two groups. The first group is 
						for kids with some or no coding experience. The second group
						is for kids with more coding experience.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What will I learn?</h3>
					<p>The first group of  
						coders will learn coding through some introductory 
						Scratch projects. Scratch is an engaging, block-based 
						programming language that is perfect for learning coding 
						without requiring much typing. But don't be fooled, 
						Scratch is an extremely powerful programming language.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second group of coders will learn more advanced 
						coding using Microsoft MakeCode Arcade projects. Arcade 
						includes advanced block-based coding, but also allows 
						for JavaScript coding. JavaScript is text-based and is 
						great for learning your first your professional language 
						after mastering Scratch. You will need to know how to 
						type to join this group. 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
					<p>Please bring a fully charged laptop computer. The main 
						seating area of the Ninestar Connect Conference Center 
						does not have electrical outlets, but we will have 
						charging tables on the sides of the room. If you do not 
						have access to a laptop, we have 10 Chromebooks 
						available for use, first come, first served. Please 
						indicate on your registration if you would like to 
						borrow one of our Chromebooks.
